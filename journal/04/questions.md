# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > | Asynchronous code does not depend on one task being done before moving to the next, Synchronous code depends on a task being complete before it can move to the next task. It can only perform one thing at a time.  |

02. What is an event listener?

  > |It is a function in a computer program that 'listens' or waits for an event to occur. Then it will run code. |

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > | This stands for Representational State Transfer. It signifies how an API should work.  |

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > |It is a piece of code that is passed as an argument to other code, which in turn is expected to call back that argument |

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > | A promise is an object that represents either completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. 'Try' will result in a resolved promise, 'catch' is used when the promise fails. We use that 'catch' method to capture the error when it fails.  |

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > | request line, header, and body. We use methods like GET, DELETE, and POST.  |

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > | API stands for Application Programming Interface. |

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > | You can use the 'await' keyword before a call to the function.|

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > |It hides data members and data functions associated with a certain class or object. Basically it prevents users and clients from seeing certain data.  |

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > | 200 OK |

11. What is a 400 error?

  > | the 400 error is a Bad Request. This means the server cannot and will not process the request due to a client error. |
