# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? I think working with API's went well this week. I found it to be very interesting and exciting, and I'm looking forward to working with them more, which will also bring a stronger understanding of just how they work. 
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise? We learned to all share an API and that way we could see content other classmates were uploading. I think this is super cool. 
- What are you struggling with? I'm still struggling to grasp the gaming concepts, and when to call those functions. I'd like to have more confidence with errors, and knowing how to debug them. 
- What would you count as a victory? The MVC pattern is making so much more sense, and I think the whole API process is awesome. Monday and Tuesday went very well. And some things from last week are starting to click. Which is exciting!
