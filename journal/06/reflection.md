# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? I feel like working with Vue went well this week. Although it is a whole new framework and it will take time for me to grasp what all can or cannot be done with it, it is deff starting to hit home, and I'm excited to see how much better things can be done in vue. 
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise? We learned how to edit account information, which was super cool 
- What are you struggling with? I still rely heavily on references, and sometimes I struggle with the logic behind making something work the way I want it to. 
- What would you count as a victory? I'm super happy with the detailed lectures, I feel like they are making sense with all the new concepts we are learning. And I was able to gain some repetition this week by putting in extra hours to redo projects, etc.
