# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? Day Four went super well this week. I was so happy with how some functions finally started to click, and I started to understand how they worked. 
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise? We learned how to use the marquee behavior to make an object move all over its provided space. 
- What are you struggling with? I struggled with the lab on Day two....building out the game app. I do not have a super strong grasp on making one big function to take the place of individual functions.
- What would you count as a victory? Definitely the Ice Cream Lab, I was very happy with being able to build a small app the did what I wanted it to do.
