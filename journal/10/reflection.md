# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? learning new concepts and gaining repetition in those concepts. The lectures were explained very well.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise? I actually love C++.
- What are you struggling with? Front end concepts. 
- What would you count as a victory? Being able to become more comfortable with C++ and SQL, and even loving it.
