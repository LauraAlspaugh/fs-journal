# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? I think gregslist went super well this week, and although we embraced many new concepts, and I am still struggling with many of them, I am finding it so exciting and good to work with the challenges. Help and tips from instructors I also found to be extremely helpful. 
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise? I think the whole mvc structure is starting to click a little more. 
- What are you struggling with? Remembering exactly which function to call when, and knowing how to fix errors/debugging.
- What would you count as a victory? Making certain things do what they are supposed to do in lab, finally understanding a new concept, and most importantly learning new things (lightbulb moments) in lecture or out in lab. At this point, the help and encouragement from the instructors has been incredible and lifesaving.
