# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern
01. What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
  
  > | abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism|

02. How does `export` differ from `export default`?
  
  > | we use export default when we want to export only a single value, but when we have multiple values and also want to organize our code into smaller reusable portions, we use export.  |

03. What is Encapsulation?
  
  > | excapsulation restricts direct access to some components of an object, and we can use it to hide data associated with that object.  |

04. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?
  
  > | it is helpful for creating objects that can be used in place of the original object, and can redefine operations and properties |

05. What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
  
  > | a class is a type of blueprint that we use to make objects, an instance of a class refers to the objects relationship to that class|

06. What is a computed Property?
  
  > | a value that can be derived from another stored value|

07. What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
  
  > | it simplifies the testing process, it has the ability to provide multiple views, and it is overall an improved developement process |

08. What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
  
  > | the controller is responsible for controlling the way the user interacts with the MVC application. the controller contains the flow logic |

09. What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
  
  > | the service retrieves and creates your model from various data sources, and updates values |

10. What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
  
  > | the model is responsible for data logic in the application, and also storing and retrieving data from back end sources |
