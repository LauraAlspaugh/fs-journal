# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? I think the lectures went well this week....and also the first and second lab assignment. 
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise? I learned how to be more mobile friendly, also makign icons turn 
- What are you struggling with? I am still struggling with accessing the command line correctly, and also some bootstrap cloning.
- What would you count as a victory? although there are still many concepts I need to grasp more clearly, i'm amazed at how much we are enacouraged to learn and accomplish in such a short period of time, for example, coding out a whole site in just one afternoon.
