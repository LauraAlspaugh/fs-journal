# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? A lot went well this week. Back end is super fun and repetitive. 
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise? Learning back end! It is so much better than I would have guessed. 
- What are you struggling with? Remembering front end. Still need to get more practice with functions. 
- What would you count as a victory? Gaining a better knowledge of backend, concepts are clicking. This whole week was a victory.
