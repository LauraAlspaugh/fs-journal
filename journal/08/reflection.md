# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? Capstones are going well this week! it's fun to be in a new learning environment, and stretch our code knowledge.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise? We worked a lot more with postman, and it was pretty cool seeing what all you can do. 
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory? Being able to work together as a group and learn new concepts and see them played out in your applications.
