# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? I feel like the week went well, a lot to accomplish, but once you get into it, things start to click and make sense.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with? completely understanding how all the relationships work with the server side of things
- What would you count as a victory? how fun the Tower project was....and that feeling when you work hard to get something to work and then it works.
